## Is This What Solar Systems Look Like?

```{r include=FALSE}

Here is an illustration, provided by NASA, of the kind of solar systems that have been identified by the [Kepler-11 probe](http://kepler.nasa.gov/Mission/discoveries/)

You have probably seen pictures like this, but with the planets in our solar system.

Or, a mechanical model, called an [orrery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orrery)

Perhaps you realize that these depictions are schematic.   The planets' orbits are further apart than shown.  We can get [quantitative data](http://btc.montana.edu/ceres/html/Weight/weightsolardata.htm) on the planet sizes and orbital distances from the sun, showing more or less what a probe on the edge of the solar system might capture.

Planet diameters are in mm, orbital radii in meters

A proportional model:
```{r}
ss <- read.csv('solarSystem.csv')
xyplot( I(0*Distance) ~ Distance, data=ss,pch=20,cex=.00002*(6378.1/14959.7870)*ss$Radius,col=rgb(.4,.4,0,.2))
```
We can't see the planets.

```{r}
xyplot( I(0*Distance) ~ Distance, data=ss,pch=20,cex=.2*(6378.1/14959.7870)*ss$Radius,col=rgb(.4,.4,0,.2))
```
The scale for the planets is roughly 10000 times larger than the scale for distance between planets.  

With a log scale:
```{r}
xyplot( I(0*Distance) ~ log(Distance), data=ss,pch=20,cex=(6378.1/14959.7870)*ss$Radius)
```

Try it with a rank scale:
```{r}
xyplot( I(0*Distance) ~ rank(Distance), data=ss,pch=20,cex=.2*(6378.1/14959.7870)*ss$Radius)
```

```{r}
xyplot( I(0*Distance) ~ rank(Distance)*log(Distance), data=ss,pch=20,cex=(6378.1/14959.7870)*ss$Radius)
```



And a square-root scale:

```{r}
xyplot( I(0*Distance) ~ sqrt(Distance), data=ss,pch=20,cex=.5*(6378.1/14959.7870)*ss$Radius)
```

Redo this in ggplot2.  Or, maybe, you'll have to do a circle and a polygon at each planet and the sun.
