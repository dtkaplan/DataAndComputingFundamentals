A graphic from the New York *Times*, "[College, the Great Unlevele](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/01/college-the-great-unleveler)," by Suzanne Mettler, March 1, 2014  about the cost of college and sources of financial aid.

### In the left-hand graph,

* What variables make up the frame?
    * Fraction of family income to pay for one year of college, and year.
* What are the guides?
    * Labels for the different quintiles of family income.
    * A line scaling the axis, showing where the fraction of family income is 100%.
    * Text to label the extent of the horizontal axis, from 1971 to 2010
* What are the glyphs?
    * A line connecting the values for 1971 and 2011, with the numerical values marked.
* Write down what the glyph-ready dataframe looks like.

Quintile        | 1971 <br>cost | 2011 <br>cost
----------------|:-----------:|:-----------:
Poorest fifth   | 42%       | 114%
Second poorist fifth  | 19%       | 46%
Middle fifth    | 13% | 46%
Next fifth      | 10% | 19%
Wealthiest fifth  | 6% | 9%
    
### For the right-hand graph, 
* What are the glyphs and what data do they represent?
    * This is tricky.  The glyphs are the segments of the circles.
* Sketch, roughly, what a stacked bar chart would look like representing the same information.
* Write down what the glyph-ready dataframe looks like.
