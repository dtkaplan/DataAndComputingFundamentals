Strategizing for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Data
========================================================

Start with the finish.  What question do you want to be able to answer?  What would be a reasonable format for your data to answer this question.  Then work backwards toward the data forms that you have available.

With the CFPB complaints, we're interested in finding some regions where complaints are heavy, and regions where complaints are light.  The table might look like this:

Table Name: `levelByRegion`

Region | ComplaintLevel
-------|----------------
East   |  2
South  | 0.5
West   | 1

ComplaintLevel is the number of complaints per capita compared to the national average.

Table Name: `ExpectedVsActualByRegion`

Region | ExpectedComplaintCount | ActualComplaintCount
-------|------------------------|---------------------
East |      20  | 10
South |     5  | 10
West |      20 | 20

Where do these variables come from.  ActualComplaintCount can come from grouping the complaints by Region.

Complaint table

Table Name: `complaintByRegion`

ComplaintID | Region |  ...
----------|----------|-----------
1001      |  East    | ...
1002      |  East    | ...
1003      |  South   | ...


ExpectedComplainCount can come from multiplying a population by the average complaint rate

Table Name: `popByRegion`

Region | Population
-------|-------------
West   | 12000
South  |  8000
East   | 10000
