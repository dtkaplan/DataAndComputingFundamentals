Converting Quantitative Variables to Categorical
======================

```{r include=FALSE}
require(DCF)
startTemplate()
require(xtable)
```

Cover
* `ifthen()` for binary splits with assigned names
* `cut()` for multi-way splits.
    * cut with logarithmic spacing: `breaks=c(0,10^(1:10),Inf)`, `paste("d",1:10)`
* `ntiles()` for evenly populated groups
    * `quantile(nm, seq(0,1,length=n))` to see the dividing points
    * `groupBy()` with `max()` and `min()` to see the breakpoints.
