### Data and Computing Fundamentals


## Data on the Web

Look at the various data sets available at <http://www.gapminder.org/data/>.

1. Based on the names of the data sets available, construct several hypotheses that you would like to test using this sort of country-by-country data.  Later in the course, you'll learn how to assemble such data in a form you can use for your analysis.
2. Look at one of the data sets (by pressing the little "View" magnifying-glass icon).  What are the cases?  What are the variables?
