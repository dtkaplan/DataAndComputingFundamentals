Week 2 Notes
==================


## Debriefing from Week 1

### The new syllabus location.  Bookmark it.

### How to use the templates

1. Copy them into an editing window.  
2. Run it first thing to verify that it works.

An [example with the exercises from Week 1](http://rpubs.com/jstrubl1/4571).  If you haven't yet done any, open up the Week 1 exercises and let's do one or two things.

### Things that people were able to do

* [A good start](http://rpubs.com/roldfath/4615) --- how could color be used to advantage here to see the difference between the sexes?
* Interesting depiction of diabetes [here](http://rpubs.com/sbauman1/4638) --- it looks like as you age the "bmi threshold" for getting diabetes goes down.  Cholesterol doesn't seem related to diabetes.  Income doesn't seem related to BMI.
* Not everything worked: 
    * [one](http://rpubs.com/siukhymo/4640) let's see if we can get this to work
    * [two](http://rpubs.com/wcraine/4611) using `xyplot` instead of `ggplot`

####  Syntax problems from week 1.

## Back to Data

You should know:
* How to load in a template.
* How to install and load the DCF package.  (You'll have to update this each week.  Grab the URL and bookmark it.)
* The meaning of `data(nhanes)` and `utils = fetchData("utilities.csv")
* How to make a scatter plot using `mScatter`
* How to cut and paste the command string for a plot into a template.

You may have already figured out,
* How to create a new variable using `transform`.

EXERCISES: 
* Compute the population density.
* Compute the fraction of the population which is female.


### What's new today: 


1. Picking a subset of cases.
1. Creating small datasets using a spreadsheet.
2. Calculating quantities on groups.
3. The bar plot format.


#### Subsets

Work through the [subsets notes](subsets.html).

#### Creating Small Datasets

Hand out the math enrollment table.  

1. Construct a bit of the table, perhaps 5 rows.  Then publish this and read it into R.
2. **Copy** the [pre-populated spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AkXIvAg85dhhdHdONnZ6aWwtRDZtc2ZyN2QxeEdJMFE&usp=sharing#gid=0).  Fill in the missing entries.  Then publish it and work with this.
3. Read in the exercises template and let's the very first one or two of the exercises.

#### Grouping

Work through the [grouping notes](GroupBy.html)

1. Return to the math enrollment spreadsheet.
2. Make a group using `sum` of enrollments by year.  
3. Do total enrollments by year and course level.  

#### Bar Plots

##### Example of a stacked bar chart in the pre-computation days.

Make bar plots of the enrollment data.
