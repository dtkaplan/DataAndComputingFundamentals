Revision Ideas
========================

### Exercises

More drill early on with Markdown documents.

Have exercises on `join()` by hand, generating the tables in markdown

### Examples

For the groupBy and barchart exercises, see the [Medicare Spending case study](../CaseStudies/MedicareSpending/notes.html)

### Strategy for Design

Generate sketches of tables.  Teach the Markdown notation for tabular stuff.  **Central Question** What does your table need to look like to answer the question of interest?  **Design Strategy** How do you get to a table like the one you need?

### Sequence

Some of the more "advanced" display/modeling modalities earlier, giving them the tables that they need.  Push off toward later how one gets to the final table.  In other words, echo the strategy of design.
