* visual esthetics

# Structure of Relational Data

## Topics
* wide vs long
* operations through join
* cleaning data/tidy data

## Country-by-Country Data

The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has a wide range of data broken down by year and country.

Access it by going to <http://faostat3.fao.org/home/index.html#DOWNLOAD>

Pick a category, select all countries and all years, choose "table" (not "pivot table") and download.  The result will be in narrow format.  

Two examples are in

1. FAO_DATA/CountryArea.csv which gives areas (including many subareas, like arable land) for each country
2. FAO_DATA/CountryPopulation.csv which gives various population numbers across the years, including total, working, rural, etc.

Introduce students to the database operations by having them make GapMinder-like graphics.

#### Comments

Find some health-related data.  FAO doesn't have this.  GAPMINDER?

## Possible Examples
* Zillow versus political donations
* from Nolan/Lang summer Berkeley course
* Verizon text telephone data (see Dick De Veaux example from JSM)
* Simple text mining: extracting sex from the Federal Election Commission database


# NOT
* No formal inference
* No grungy programming
