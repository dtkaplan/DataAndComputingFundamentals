Tools/Resources to Consider
========================================================

As we find new things, let's list them here so that we have a record.

### Data

* Gapminder: <http://www.gapminder.org/data>
* Environmental, country-by-country: <http://epi.yale.edu/downloads>

### Unexamined

* [Hadoop and R](http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Using-R-Hadoop-webinar-January-77616.S.202738754?view=&gid=77616&type=member&item=202738754&trk=eml-anet_dig-b_nd-pst_ttle-cn&_mSplash=1)

### In progress

* ggplot2 --- Danny is writing a simple R-GUI for this, so that students can construct plots easily and get the command out.
* rworldmap --- for making easy world maps.

### Discarded

Put the things we've decided not to use here.
