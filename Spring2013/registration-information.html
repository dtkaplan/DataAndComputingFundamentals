<h1>Registering for </h1>

<h2><em>Data and Computing Fundamentals</em> for Spring 2013</h2>

<p>At the end of last semester, you expressed interest in the upcoming <em>Data and Computing Fundamentals</em> mini-course.  This is a 1-credit introduction to computing with &ldquo;big data&rdquo; that is being developed with the support of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.  </p>

<ul>
<li>There are <strong>no pre-requisites</strong>, either in mathematics, computation, or science.</li>
<li>There will be an emphasis on data in bioscience- and medical-related contexts, but the techniques are very general and applicable to many, many fields.</li>
<li>The class will meet on seven Tuesday evenings at 7:00-8:30pm starting Feb. 19 and ending on April 9.</li>
<li>The instructors are Profs. Libby Shoop and Danny Kaplan</li>
<li>This is a prototype course.  Over a period of two years, our plan is to expand enrollment from this semester&#39;s 20 students to approximately 200 students per year (in many sections).  According to the plan, the course will eventually become a co-requisite for several widely enrolled introductory science, statistics, and mathematics courses.</li>
<li>The development of the course at Macalester is being followed by a consortium of liberal arts colleges, so in addition to teaching the course, we will be documenting what works and what doesn&#39;t work.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Plan</h3>

<p>Forty-five students expressed interest and availability for the Tuesday 7-8:30pm meeting time.  In order to ensure that there is plenty of one-on-one contact, there is room only for twenty students this semester.</p>

<p>We propose to choose those twenty in a two-step process.  </p>

<ol>
<li>You write back to us to confirm your continuing interest and availability on Tuesday 7-8:30pm and your acceptance of a few conditions, described below. <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/macalester.edu/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGFPTzEyOXNtdENSb3l0Sk9Fa2VqZ1E6MQ">Here&#39;s a link to a Google form for this purpose</a>.</li>
<li>From the people who respond to (1) in the affirmative, we will select 20 at random (using a statistical process called &ldquo;blocking&rdquo; to ensure balance among disciplines).</li>
</ol>

<h4>The Conditions</h4>

<ol>
<li>You&#39;ll register for COMP 194 (the number assigned by the registrar for intro prototype courses) for 1 credit, taking it with a pass-fail option.</li>
<li>You&#39;ll complete the course.  That is, you will attend each of the seven 1.5 hours Tuesday evening sessions (barring extra-ordinary circumstances such as sickness) and will commit to spend three to four hours each week on homework/reading during the seven weeks of the course, handing in as much of the assignments as you can reasonably do during that time.</li>
<li>You will commit to participating in some short surveys and course evaluation questions during the semester and over the next year or so <em>even if you don&#39;t end up selected for the course</em>.  The reason for this is to enable us to examine the effect of the course, comparing students who take the course to those who do not but who express a similar level of interest.</li>
<li>Students who are not selected for the Spring 2013 session will have the opportunity to take the course in 2013-14.</li>
<li>Text materials will be provided to the students in the course for free.</li>
</ol>
