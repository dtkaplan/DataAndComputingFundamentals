This csv data set example contains records of US flights between 2000-2011 that have been struck by a bird while in flight.

I found this at http://www.play-r.com/file/view/323/bird-strikes-csv


Ask some simple questions:
* When do the bird strikes occur?
* What states?
* What airplane types?

etc.
