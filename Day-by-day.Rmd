Day-by-Day Objectives for Data and Computing Fundamentals
=====================

Day 1
--------------

### In Class
1. Create a "Hello, World" type markdown document
    * Change the default Rmd document to include mosaic and DCF
2. Projection operations on tables
    * Read in a table already in a good form, e.g. area and population for many countries
3. Simple case-by-case calculations
    * e.g. population density
4. Scatterplots
    * Selection of variables and assignment to axes
    * Log axes.  See [xkcd cartoon](http://xkcd.com/1162/)
    * Attributes for points: shapes, colors
    
### Development Resources

* Scatterplots: Cookbook for R<http://wiki.stdout.org/rcookbook/Graphs/Scatterplots%20(ggplot2)>
    
### Exercises

### Project Assignment

Create a markdown document with some informative scatter plot.  Document the creation of the graph and interpret it.



Day 2
--------------
1. Selection of cases
    * Comparison operators and boolean combinations
    * e.g., picking out a specific year from a larger data set
2. Group operations
    * counts of cases
    * lists of levels, and data cleaning
3. Graphics
    * barplots
        * side-by-side
        * stacked
    * "mosaic" plots
    * parallel coordinates
4. Tidy data
    * Narrow versus wide format

### Development Resources

* Barplots: Cookbook for R<http://wiki.stdout.org/rcookbook/Graphs/Bar%20and%20line%20graphs%20(ggplot2)/>
* Narrow to wide (and *vice versa*): Cookbook for R<http://wiki.stdout.org/rcookbook/Manipulating%20data/Converting%20data%20between%20wide%20and%20long%20format/>

### Basic Learning Objectives

Putting titles on graphs, captions on tables, etc. e.g. have the students make a report with a summary table that's nicely formatted?  Insist that titles, axes, units all be on the graphics.

### Data Sets
* The UN Agricultural organization data in a wide format
* The chocolate-shop sales data in a wide format.  See [this letter](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?shva=1#inbox/13b76703fd8dec48) regarding Chris Curtis's data.  
* Weather in Saint Paul.  [data site](http://cdo.ncdc.noaa.gov/qclcd/QCLCD)
* Grades 
* Body Shape

Day 3
--------------
1. Join
2. Maps --- join the country data with the geographical data

### Development Resources

* Maps
    * [In ggplot2](http://spatialanalysis.co.uk/2012/02/great-maps-ggplot2/)
    * [plotting shapefiles](http://uce.uniovi.es/mundor/howtoplotashapemap.html)
    * [New geoms in ggplot2](http://cloud.github.com/downloads/hadley/ggplot2/guide-col.pdf)
    * `maps` and `mapdata` packages.  
        * `maps` is pretty small and contains just a few maps: US, World low resolution.  See `example(maps)`
        * `mapdata` is 25MB and contains higher resolution maps of the world, rivers, Japan, and China
